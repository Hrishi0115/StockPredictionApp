File System Structure in WSL

WSL Home directory:

- The home directory in WSL is similar to the home directory on a native Linux system
- It is located at `home/your_username` = `home/hrishi0115` = `~`
- E.g. `~/airflow/dags` = `/home/hrishi0115/airflow/dags`

/mnt Directory:

- The directory where WSL mounts your Windows file system
- For example, your C: drive in Windows is accessible at `/mnt/C/` in WSL
- this allows you to access your Windows files from within the WSL environment


To access the files in your WSL area via file explorer by typing `\\wsl` in the file explorer search bar (large search bar)
