Ubuntu:
- popular open-source operating system based on Linux.
- widely used for servers, desktops, cloud computing, and development environments due to its stability, security, and the extensive community support

WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux):
- a compatability layer developed by Microsoft that enables Windows users to run Linux binary executables natively on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019


Why use WSL and Ubuntu for Airflow?

- Apache Airflow is an open-source automation tool used for orchestrating complex computational workflows and data processing pipelines.
- primarly designed to run on UNIX-based systems (Linux and macOS), which provides a more consistent and reliable environment for its dependencies
and operations

Reason for Using WSL and Ubuntu:
- Compatability: airflow and many of its dependencies are better supported and more stable on Linux environments
- Ease of setup: using WSL allows you to set up a Linux environment without needing to leave Windows, avoiding the complexities of managing a seperate Linux machine 
or a full virtual machine.
- Development Flexibility: You get the benefit of using powerful Linux tools and utilities directly within your Windows environment, improving your development workflow.
- Resource Efficiency: WSL is lightweight and consumes fewer resources compared to running a full virtual machine, making it efficient for development tasks.
